#ServiceStack.Core 1.0.44 & .Net Core 2.0#

This repository is meant to demonstrate some of the pitfalls of working
with .Net Core 2.0, Asp.Net Core 2.0, and ServiceStack.  The problems
arise, mostly, from default configurations and an incomplete understanding
of how ServiceStack.Core works in concert with .Net Core 2.0 and
Asp.Net Core 2.0.

The information shared in this repository is meant as a means to ease the
burden of others who may run into similar issues.  In no way is it meant to
criticize the amazing work Microsoft and ServiceStack have done.
